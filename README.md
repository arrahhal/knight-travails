# Knight travails

This script finds the shortest path between the starting square and the ending square on a chessboard that a knight can move to, using the BFS search algorithm.

**Usage**: The `knightMoves` function accepts two parameters: the starting position and the ending position. It then prints the path between them like so:

```terminal
  > knightMoves([3,3],[4,3])
  => You made it in 3 moves!  Here's your path:
    [3,3]
    [4,5]
    [2,4]
    [4,3]
```
